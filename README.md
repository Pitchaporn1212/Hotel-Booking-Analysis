Based on the data provided, the hotel received a total of 119,390 bookings, with 37% of them being canceled, leaving a net total of 75,000 confirmed bookings. During this time, the hotel served over 146,000 customers.

When examining booking trends, there is a noticeable increase in booking volume from August to October each year. However, the Average Daily Rate (ADR) remains relatively stable at $99.99 throughout the year, with guests staying an average of 3 nights. Room Type A is the most popular, with 52,000 bookings, while Room Type L had only 4 bookings. Most customers, around 57,000, opted for the Bed & Breakfast (BB) meal plan.

The online travel agent segment is particularly active, with Airbnb being the most frequently used platform within this category. However, direct bookings with the hotel outnumber those made through any travel agent.

In the customer analysis, it was observed that bookings made more than 60 days in advance have a higher cancellation rate of 48%, compared to a 24% cancellation rate for those made within 60 days.

Furthermore, the data reveals that repeat customers make up only 4% of the total, indicating potential dissatisfaction with the service, which might be contributing to the low return rate. Additionally, only 8% of customers are classified as family groups, suggesting that the hotel may not be well-suited for families with children. This is further supported by the fact that only 0.12% of family-type guests have returned to the hotel.

Despite this, it is worth noting that the top five countries for bookings are all European, suggesting that the hotel has effectively targeted and marketed its services to European travelers.

The graph also shows that the majority of customers are "Transient" guests, with 53,000 bookings, including 2,800 repeat bookings. Additionally, most customers prefer to book without a deposit, as reflected by the 75,000 bookings without a deposit shown on the graph.
