When examining booking trends, there is a noticeable increase in booking volume from August to October each year. However, the Average Daily Rate (ADR) remains relatively stable at $99.99 throughout the year, with guests staying an average of 3 nights. Room Type A is the most popular, with 52,000 bookings, while Room Type L had only 4 bookings. Most customers, around 57,000, opted for the Bed & Breakfast (BB) meal plan.

The online travel agent segment is particularly active, with Airbnb being the most frequently used platform within this category. However, direct bookings with the hotel outnumber those made through any travel agent.
